## Setup

1. Ensure you have python3 installed on your system

2. download 'main.py' and create a 'roulette_users.txt' with names and balances (each on a new line) formatted like this
```
   Name,30
   John,156
   ```
3. Then run ```main.py```

4. The name you enter to the question 'Who is betting' is case-insensative to the text file
   Then once everyone has gone through and placed their bets
   type 'done' inside the "Who is betting?" question

## File Format

The roulette_users.txt file stores player information. Ensure it follows the format:

```
Name,Amount
```
Each playerâ€™s name and balance should be on a new line.
Do **not** put commas in players' names or balances.
Balances should be fully integer. No floats or commas

## Adding New Players
To add new players:

Open 'roulette_users.txt'.
Add a new line with the player's name and their starting balance in the following format:
```
NewPlayerName,StartingBalance
```
Example:
```
Chris,125
```

## Customization

In the 'main.py' file at the bottom, there are variables listed out names, values, and descriptions
There you can copy the name of a variable -> do CNTR + F (or CMD + F) to then search for the variable
Find where it is initialized and change the value there. 
**Read The Descriptions Carefully**
